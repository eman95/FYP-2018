				About three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions that are attributed to humans come from burning fossil fuels. We burn fossil fuels, which are non-renewable energy sources, when we operate vehicles, heat our homes, and even use electricity. The greenhouse gas emissions have been on the rise since industrialization, suggesting that humans are to blame for much of the greenhouse gas production and science has also linked greenhouse gas production to climate change, or the increase in earth’s temperature. Because global warming can cause catastrophic weather events such as flooding, water shortages and disturbed ecosystems, it is important for each individual to understand his or her impact on the future and work to make that impact more positive.

			Greenhouse gases are able to absorb long wave radiation (heat) that is reflected off the Earth’s surface. They are then able to reemit this radiation back down to Earth. If there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the Earth would be too cold for life as we know it to exist. However, as more fossil fuels are burnt and other greenhouse gases are released, the atmosphere is able to absorb more radiation and so is warming up. This is known as the greenhouse effect.
