	<h4>WHAT IS CARBON FOOTPRINT?</h4>
	<p title="What is Carbon Footprint?" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 10px;">A carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). In other words, when the user drives a car, the engine burns fuel which creates a certain amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, depending on its fuel consumption and the driving distance. When the user heats their house with oil, gas or coal, also generates CO<sub>2</sub>. Even if electricity is used, the generation of the electrical power may also have emitted a certain amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. When the user buys food and goods, the production of the food and goods also emitted some quantities of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

	<h4>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h4>
	<p title="Why is it important?" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 10px">Carbon footprint is a way to provide a number to the release of greenhouse gases by a particular action.  Once a person or organization has that number, then they can figure out what steps to take to lower that number, either by finding ways to release less greenhouse gases or by doing something that mitigates the greenhouse gases released (planting trees, for example).  Since most evidence supports the fact that greenhouse gases are causing climate change, if an organization, product, person, or event can lower its total carbon footprint, then it can help slow climate change.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px">Quantifying the usersâ€™ greenhouse gas emissions is important because it helps the users to understand what their key emission sources are, how they contribute to global emissions, and what opportunities they have to reduce their emissions. With the information gained by quantifying their greenhouse gas emissions, the users can then develop a carbon reduction plan, identifying ways to reduce their carbon footprint and limit emissions from future activities and then measure what progress they have made. This will help the users understand what impact they are having on climate change. This will help them identify and prioritize areas for reducing emissions, which will often result in cost savings as well.</p>
