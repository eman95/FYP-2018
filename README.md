Final Year Project 2018

This is my Final Year Project in UPM (2018)

The Project is called Carbon Footprint Application (CFA) For Household Utility Users


**Project Overview**

The purpose of the Carbon Footprint Application is to increase the
awareness of total greenhouse emissions caused directly or indirectly by an
individual. Carbon footprint accounts for all six of the greenhouse gas
emissions which are Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide
(N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and Sulphur
Hexafluoride (SF6). It is expressed in Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e), which
is the unit of measurement which allows different greenhouse gases to be
compared on a basis relative to one unit of CO2. CO2e emissions are calculated
by multiplying the emissions of each of the six greenhouse gases by its 100 –
year global warming potential.

There are two types of carbon footprint, organizational carbon footprint
and product carbon footprint. An organizational carbon footprint measures the
greenhouse gas emissions caused from all the activities across the
organization directly or indirectly, including energy used in buildings, industrial
processes and company vehicles. A product carbon footprint measures the
greenhouse gas emissions over the whole life of a product (goods or services),
from the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing right through to its use
and final re-use, recycling or disposal. The Carbon Footprint Application will
be calculating the organizational carbon footprint of a user. The application
calculates the carbon footprint by using the total household utility usage (water,
electricity, gas and waste).

Quantifying the users’ greenhouse gas emissions is important because
it helps the users to understand what their key emission sources are, how they
contribute to global emissions, and what opportunities they have to reduce
their emissions. With the information gained by quantifying their greenhouse
gas emissions, the users can then develop a carbon reduction plan, identifying
ways to reduce their carbon footprint and limit emissions from future activities
and then measure what progress they have made. This will help the users
understand what impact they are having on climate change. This will help them
identify and prioritize areas for reducing emissions, which will often result in
cost savings as well.
